# Adventure-Guy
## Description
This is a platformer game that I designed called "Adventure Guy".
Similar to my first project, this is also coded in 100% Java using knowledge that I've accumulated over time.
All my code has comments to show why each line of code was written and its purpose.

This object of this game is basically reach the end of each level while scoring as many points as possible.

I've also included what would have been the background music for the game but I never figured out how to put it in without exceptions or errors.

## Installation
There will be a .jar file in the repository where the game can be downloaded.
Once downloaded, simply open the file to play the game.

## Usage
1. Use Arrow Keys to move and jump.
2. Press Shift to open chests for weapons and coins.
3. Use Number Keys to select weapons in inventory (it's spelled wrong in the game, my apologies).
4. Press Space to use weapon on enemies.
5. Get points by opening chests, collecting coins, and killing enemies.
6. Advance through levels by walking into doors and flags.

After full game is completed, the game will ask for your name in a separate window which you are required to fill in. 

Then, the game will save your name and score in two text files which will later on be read to populate the leaderboard.


Note: When first opening, the game might take unusually long to load (10-20 seconds).
