# Adventure-Guy
## Description
This is a platformer game that I designed called "Adventure Guy".
Similar to my first project, this is also coded in 100% Java using knowledge that I've accumulated over time.
All my code has comments to show why each line of code was written and its purpose.

This object of this game is basically reach the end of each level while scoring as many points as possible.

I've also included what would have been the background music for the game but I never figured out how to put it in without exceptions or errors.

## Installation
To install the game, simply download the .jar file from the repository. Then to play the game, you need to open the file to run it. You also need to make sure the Java JDK is installed on your computer.

You may encounter some problems running the file on Mac, mainly with a warning saying that the game is from an unidentified developer. This warning can be circumvented by two-finger clicking on the file and clicking the "open" option in the drop down. Then a new warning will pop up with an option asking you if you still want to open it which you will click "open" again. Then, you will be prompted to enter your macs username and password which is required to whitelist the game from your software blocker.

To my knowledge, you will not encounter a similar problem on windows. However, if you do, there are numerous forums and help for running .jar files from unidentified developers.

Please note, despite the warnings, I assure you that this game does not contain any malicious or harmful code and that this is simply a project.

## Usage
1. Use Arrow Keys to move and jump.
2. Press Shift to open chests for weapons and coins.
3. Use Number Keys to select weapons in inventory (it's spelled wrong in the game, my apologies).
4. Press Space to use weapon on enemies.
5. Get points by opening chests, collecting coins, and killing enemies.
6. Advance through levels by walking into doors and flags.

After full game is completed, the game will ask for your name in a separate window which you are required to fill in. 

Then, the game will save your name and score in two text files which will later on be read to populate the leaderboard.


Note: When first opening, the game might take unusually long to load (10-20 seconds).
