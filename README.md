# Adventure-Guy
## Description
This is a platformer game that I designed called "Adventure Guy".
Similar to my first project, this is also coded in 100% Java using knowledge that I've accumulated over time.
All my code has comments to show why each line of code was written and its purpose.

This object of this game is basically reach the end of each level while scoring as many points as possible.

## Installation
There will be a .jar file in the repository where the game can be downloaded.
Once downloaded, simply open the file to play the game.
